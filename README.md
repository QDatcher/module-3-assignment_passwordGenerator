    If at least one of the character types is selected the following prompt will ask for users to give a numeral input from 8-128

![prompt asking user to select number from 8 - 128](assets/images/88.png)

    -If the input fits the criteria, a password will be generated like shown above (the generated password shows after you click ok. The one shown above was generated in a previous attempt)

    -If the the input doesn't fit the criteria because the number is too big or small a message "try again :)" will appear along with an alert explaining the number was out of bounds

![alert showing the player is out of bounds](assets/images/out-of-bounds.png)

    If the user placed anything outside of a number into the prompt then the message "try again :)" will appear along with an alert saying the input was invalid
